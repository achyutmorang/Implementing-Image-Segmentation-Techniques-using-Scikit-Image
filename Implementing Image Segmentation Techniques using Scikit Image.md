## Introduction

​	Image segmentation is a critical process in computer vision. It involves dividing a visual input into segments to simplify image analysis. Segments represent objects or parts of objects, and comprise sets of pixels. Image segmentation sorts pixels into larger components, eliminating the need to consider individual pixels as units of observation.

​	This report is an account of using Scikit-Image -- an open source Python package designed for image preprocessing, to experiment with some of the Image Segmentation Techniques listed below (the list not being exhaustive though) --



1. Edge Detection using  Roberts, Sobel and Prewitt Operators

2. Canny Edge Detection
3. Hysteresis Thresholding

3. Thresholding - local and global

7. Multi-Otsu Thresholding

8. Active Contour Model
